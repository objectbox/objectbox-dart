# Flutter database for fast Dart object persistence üíô

ObjectBox Flutter database is a great option for storing Dart objects locally in your cross-platform apps. It uses minimal CPU, memory and battery, which makes it an ideal choice for mobile and IoT devices. Made for efficient data access, it is 10x faster than any alternative across all CRUD operations. See the [performance benchmarks](#flutter-database-performance-benchmarks) below. No need to learn SQL, as our NoSQL database uses a pure Dart API that is easy to work with and can be integrated in minutes. Plus: We built a data synchronization solution that allows you to choose which objects to sync when and keep data easily and efficiently in sync across devices.

### Features

üèÅ **High performance** - improving response rates and enabling real-time applications.\
ü™Ç **ACID compliant** - Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable.\
üíª **Multiplatform** - Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows.\
üå± **Scalable** - grows with your app, handling millions of objects with ease.

üîó **Relations** - object links / relationships are built-in.\
üíê **Queries** - filter data as needed, even across relations.\
ü¶Æ **Statically typed** - compile time checks & optimizations.\
üìÉ **Schema migration** - change your model with confidence.

Oh, and there is one more thing...
üòÆ [**Data Sync**](https://objectbox.io/sync/) - keeps data in sync offline or online, between devices and servers.

## Getting Started

To start using ObjectBox in your Flutter/Dart app, head over to

* the [ObjectBox pub.dev page](https://pub.dev/packages/objectbox) or
* check out our [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.objectbox.io/getting-started).
* if you prefer video, in this tutorial you'll [learn how to persist data locally in your Flutter App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBlr8F8m9lo)

## Flutter Database Performance Benchmarks

We tested across the four main database operations, CRUD (create, read, update, delete). Each test was run multiple times and executed  manually outside of the measured time. Data preparation and evaluation were also done outside of the measured time. 

Here are the benchmarks for ObjectBox vs sqflite vs Hive üëá

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart/main/.github/benchmarks.png)

You can run these yourself using our [objectbox-dart-performance](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart-performance) Flutter benchmark app.

## Contributing

Do you want to check out the ObjectBox code itself? E.g. see in action, run tests, or even contribute code?
Great! Clone/check out this repository and run this to generate code and get you started quickly:

    ./tool/init.sh

Also, make sure to have a look at the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) - we are looking forward to your contribution.

## Packages

This repository holds all ObjectBox Dart/Flutter packages as separate directories:

* [objectbox](objectbox) - main library code
* [objectbox_generator](generator) - code generator
* [objectbox_flutter_libs](flutter_libs) - core binary library dependency for Flutter (Android/iOS) - no dart/flutter code
* [objectbox_sync_flutter_libs](sync_flutter_libs) - core binary library dependency with [**ObjectBox Sync**](https://objectbox.io/sync/) enabled
* [benchmark](benchmark) - used internally to microbenchmark and compare various implementations during development of objectbox-dart

There's also a separate repository benchmarking objectbox (and other databases) in Flutter: 
[objectbox-dart-performance](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart-performance). And another one testing and 
comparing the performance of our FlatBuffers fork vs the upstream version: [flatbuffers-benchmark](https://github.com/objectbox/flatbuffers-benchmark).

## Other languages/bindings

ObjectBox supports multiple platforms and languages: 

* [ObjectBox Java / Kotlin](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-java): runs on Android, desktop, and servers.
* [ObjectBox Swift](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-swift): build fast mobile apps for iOS and macOS 
* [ObjectBox Go](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-go): great for data-driven tools and embedded server applications 
* [ObjectBox C and C++](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-c): native speed with zero copy access to FlatBuffer objects
