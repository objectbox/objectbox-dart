# Flutter database for fast Dart object persistence 💙

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/objectbox.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/objectbox)

Flutter database to store & sync objects across devices with a sustainable offline-first approach

🏁 **High performance** on mobile and restricted devices, like IoT gateways, microcontrollers, ECUs etc.\
🪂 **Resourceful** with minimal CPU, power and memory usage for maximum flexibility and sustainability\
🔗 **Relations:** object links / relationships are built-in\
💻 **Multiplatform:** Linux, Windows, Android, iOS, macOS

🌱 **Scalable:** handling millions of objects resource-efficiently with ease\
💐 **Queries:** filter data as needed, even across relations\
🦮 **Statically typed:** compile time checks & optimizations\
📃 **Automatic schema migrations:** no update scripts needed

**And much more than just data persistence**\
👥 **[ObjectBox Sync](https://objectbox.io/sync/):** keeps data in sync between devices and servers\
🕒 **[ObjectBox TS](https://objectbox.io/time-series-database/):** time series extension for time based data

## Getting Started (in your App)

To start using ObjectBox in your Flutter/Dart app, head over to

* the [ObjectBox pub.dev page](https://pub.dev/packages/objectbox) or
* check out our [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.objectbox.io/getting-started).

## Getting Started with this Repository 

Do you want to check out the ObjectBox code itself? E.g. see in action, run tests, or even contribute code?
Great! Clone/check out this repository and run this to generate code and get you started quickly:

    ./tool/init.sh

Also, make sure to have a look at the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) - we are looking forward to your contribution.

## Packages

This repository holds all ObjectBox Dart/Flutter packages as separate directories:

* [objectbox](objectbox) - main library code
* [objectbox_generator](generator) - code generator
* [objectbox_flutter_libs](flutter_libs) - core binary library dependency for Flutter (Android/iOS) - no dart/flutter code
* [objectbox_sync_flutter_libs](sync_flutter_libs) - core binary library dependency with [**ObjectBox Sync**](https://objectbox.io/sync/) enabled
* [benchmark](benchmark) - used internally to microbenchmark and compare various implementations during development of objectbox-dart

There's also a separate repository benchmarking objectbox (and other databases) in Flutter: 
[objectbox-dart-performance](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart-performance). And another one testing and 
comparing the performance of our FlatBuffers fork vs the upstream version: [flatbuffers-benchmark](https://github.com/objectbox/flatbuffers-benchmark).

## Other languages/bindings

ObjectBox supports multiple platforms and languages: 

* [ObjectBox Java / Kotlin](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-java): runs on Android, desktop, and servers.
* [ObjectBox Swift](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-swift): build fast mobile apps for iOS and macOS 
* [ObjectBox Go](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-go): great for data-driven tools and embedded server applications 
* [ObjectBox C and C++](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-c): native speed with zero copy access to FlatBuffer objects
