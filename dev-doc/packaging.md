Packaging of ObjectBox
======================
Currently published packages on pub.dev:

* Main package: https://pub.dev/packages/objectbox
* Generator package: https://pub.dev/packages/objectbox_generator
* Flutter libraries (to pull in platform specific dependencies):
  * https://pub.dev/packages/objectbox_flutter_libs
  * https://pub.dev/packages/objectbox_sync_flutter_libs

Given requirements by Flutter and pub.dev
-----------------------------------------
Flutter 1.20 changed a few things, resulting in the addition of a Flutter plugin package.

Basics from the Flutter docs:

* C/C++ interop 
  * [Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/c-interop) 
  * [Android](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/android/c-interop)
  * [iOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/ios/c-interop)
  * [macOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/macos/c-interop)
* [Developing packages & plugins](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages)

Our situation:

* To work with Flutter, we currently must define a plugin (since Flutter 1.20) as a workaround
  * Otherwise, the iOS build currently fails with the ObjectBox.framework not being added 
* For now, we have no use for a Flutter plugin, we provide dummy versions because "we have to"
  * From the [docs](https://api.flutter.dev/javadoc/io/flutter/embedding/engine/plugins/FlutterPlugin.html):
    "A Flutter plugin allows Flutter developers to interact with a host platform, e.g., Android and iOS, via Dart code"
  * Currently, our Flutter plugins for Android & iOS implement a MethodChannel, as generated by 
    `flutter create --org io.objectbox --template=plugin --platforms=android,ios,linux,macos,windows objectbox`
* We would like to have a clean "Dart" package without Flutter dependency
  * If we remain forced to have Flutter Plugins, we have to provide an additional package for that 
* There seems to be no way to define any platform-specifics in Dart packaging (e.g. which platforms are supported)  
* "name" from pubspec.yaml defines:
  * what users need to import - Limits what we can do, e.g. we want users to import "objectbox"
  * how the ios/*.podspec is called (same as the dart/flutter package name from pubspec, i.e. objectbox if in the main package)
