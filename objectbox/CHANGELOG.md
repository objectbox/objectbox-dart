## latest

* New `@Entity()` annotation field `type realClass` to support some custom code generators. 

## 1.0.0 (2021-05-18)

* New Box `putAsync()` returning a `Future` and `putQueued()` for asynchronous writes.
* Query now supports auto-closing. You can still call `close()` manually if you want to free native resources sooner 
  than they would be by Dart's garbage collector, but it's not mandatory anymore.
* Change the "meta-model" fields to provide completely type-safe query building.
  Conditions you specify are now checked at compile time to match the queried entity.
* Make property queries fully typed, `PropertyQuery.find()` now returns the appropriate `List<...>` type without casts.
* Query conditions `inside()` renamed to `oneOf()`, `notIn()` and `notInList()` renamed to `notOneOf()`.
* Query `stream` and `findStream()` are replaced by `QueryBuilder.watch()`, i.e. `box.query(...).watch()`.
* New Query `stream()` to stream objects all the while the query is executed in the background.
* New Query condition `between()` for integers and IDs.
* Store `subscribe<EntityType>()` renamed to `watch()`.
* Store `subscribeAll()` replaced by a shared broadcast stream `entityChanges`.
* Entities can now contain `final` fields and they're properly stored/loaded (must be constructor params).
* Flutter desktop - native library is now downloaded automatically, same as for mobile platforms.
* Follow exception-vs-error throwing conventions - throwing errors when it's a permanent developer-caused error. Namely,
  there's a new `UniqueViolationException` thrown when an object you're trying to `put()` would violate a `Unique()` index.
* Even higher than usual amount of internal optimizations and improvements.
* Update to objectbox-c v0.14.0.
* Update to objectbox-swift v1.6.0.
* Update to objectbox-android v2.9.2-RC.

## 0.14.0 (2021-04-01)

* Fix non-nullable `DateTime` fields deserialization regression (introduced in v0.13.0) - fields were read as nanosecond instead of millisecond timestamp.
* Respect case-sensitivity setting in string `PropertyQuery.count()` with `distinct = true` (the result was always like with `caseSensitive = true`).
* Query `findFirst()` doesn't change `Query` object's `offset` and `limit` anymore.  
* Change Query string conditions `caseSensitive` default to `true`, previously conditions were case-insensitive by default.
* Introduce Store constructor argument `queriesCaseSensitiveDefault` - allows changing the default value of `caseSensitive` in queries.
  This includes string `PropertyQuery` when using `distinct = true`.
* Get around Flutter's Android release build issue by changing the code the compiler had trouble with.
* Remove deprecated APIs from internal plugin interfaces (deprecation notice printed during Flutter build).  
* Generator - update dependencies to their null-safe versions.
* Generated code - avoid more linter issues.

## 0.13.0 (2021-03-19)

* Null-safety support: both in the library and the generated code.
* Remove deprecated arguments `offset`, `limit`, `withEqual` from `Query` methods.

* Update to objectbox-c v0.13.0
* Update to objectbox-android v2.9.1
* Increase minimum SDK versions: Flutter v2.0 & Dart v2.12.

## 0.12.2 (2021-03-11)

* Fix `ToMany` relation internal ID assignment when multiple relations are used.
* Support `ToMany` relation code generation regardless of order of class definitions.

## 0.12.1 (2021-03-05)

* Further performance optimizations in our FlatBuffers fork.
* Avoid empty FFI structs - get rid of "INFO" messages with new Dart SDK v2.12.
* More internal changes in preparation for null-safety. 

## 0.12.0 (2021-02-26)

* Recognize `DateTime` entity fields, setting `PropertyType.date` (millisecond storage precision). 
* Support specifying `PropertyType.dateNano` for `DateTime` fields (nanosecond storage precision).  
* Add `Store.reference` getter and `Store.fromReference()` factory - enabling access to store from multiple isolates.
* Add `Store.subscribe<EntityType>()` and `Store.subscribeAll()` data change event streams.
* Add multiple `SyncClient` event streams.
* Add `Query` conditions for `lessOrEqual`/`greaterOrEqual` on integer and double property types.
* Add self-assignable IDs: annotation `@Id(assignable: true)`.  
* Update to objectbox-c v0.12.0
* Update to objectbox-android v2.9.0
* Update to objectbox-swift v1.5.0
* Increase minimum SDK versions: Flutter v1.20 & Dart v2.9. Code generator already required Flutter v1.22 & Dart v2.10. 

## 0.11.2 (2021-03-11)

* Fix `ToMany` relation internal ID assignment when multiple relations are used.
* Support `ToMany` relation code generation regardless of order of class definitions.

## 0.11.1 (2021-02-26)

* Fix `List<String>` and `List<int>` reading - replace official FlatBuffers lazy reader with a custom (eager) one.

## 0.11.0 (2021-02-01)

* Add `ToOne<>` class to wrap related entities. See examples for details.
  (thanks [@Buggaboo](https://github.com/Buggaboo) for jump-starting this).
* Add `ToMany<>` class to wrap related entities. See examples for details.
* Significantly improve `Box` read and write performance.
* Change `Box.put()` and `putMany()` - now also update given object's ID property.
  Note: If you previously `put()` the same new object instance multiple times without setting id, the object will now
  be inserted only the first time, and overwritten on subsequent puts of the same instance, its ID is not zero anymore.
* Change `Box.putMany()` and `Query.FindIds()` to return fixed-size lists.
* Change `Box.GetMany()` to return a fixed-size list by default, with an option to return a growable list.
* Change `@Id()` annotation to optional - recognized automatically if there's an `int id` field (case insensitive).
* Make `observable.dart` part of `objectbox.dart` exports, no need to import it separately.  
* Expose `PutMode` - allowing semantics choice between put, update and insert.
* Hide internal classes not intended for general use (e.g. all Model* classes).
* Rename `versionLib()` to `nativeLibraryVersion()`.
* Change `TxMode` enum values to lowercase.
* Remove `flags` from the `Property()` annotation.

* Add `Query.remove()` to remove all objects matching the query.
* Fix `Query.findStream()` to only rerun on changes to the queried type
  (thanks [@RTrackerDev](https://github.com/RTrackerDev) and [@Buggaboo](https://github.com/Buggaboo) for [#152](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart/pull/152)).
* Change `type` field on `@Property()` annotation to PropertyType.
* Mark `offset` and `limit` query parameters deprecated, use `offset()` and `limit()` instead.
* Update to objectbox-swift 1.4.1
* Internal changes in preparation for null-safety (still waiting for our dependencies to migrate).

## 0.9.0 (2020-11-12)

* Update to objectbox-c 0.11.0

    (thanks [@Buggaboo](https://github.com/Buggaboo) for [#88](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart/pull/88))
