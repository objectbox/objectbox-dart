# Flutter database for Dart-native objects 💙

ObjectBox Flutter database is a great option for storing Dart objects in your cross-platform apps. Minimal CPU, memory and battery use make it an ideal choice for mobile and IoT devices. Made for efficient data access, the ObjectBox Flutter database is 10x faster than any alternative. See the [performance benchmarks](#flutter-database-performance-benchmarks) below. No need to learn SQL, as our NoSQL database uses a pure Dart API that is easy to work with and can be integrated in minutes. Plus: We built a data synchronization solution that allows you to choose which objects to sync when and keep data easily and efficiently in sync across devices.

### Features

🏁 **High performance** - improving response rates and enabling real-time applications.\
🪂 **ACID compliant** - Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable.\
💻 **Multiplatform** - Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows.\
🌱 **Scalable** - grows with your app, handling millions of objects with ease.

🔗 **Relations** - object links / relationships are built-in.\
💐 **Queries** - filter data as needed, even across relations.\
🦮 **Statically typed** - compile time checks & optimizations.\
📃 **Schema migration** - change your model with confidence.

Oh, and there is one more thing...
😮 [**Data Sync**](https://objectbox.io/sync/) - keeps data in sync offline or online, between devices and servers.


## Sneak peek - persist Dart objects with ObjectBox 

```dart
@Entity()
class Person {
  int id;

  String firstName;
  String lastName;

  Person({this.id = 0, required this.firstName, required this.lastName});
}

final store = await openStore(); 
final box = store.box<Person>();

var person = Person(firstName: 'Joe', lastName: 'Green');

final id = box.put(person);  // Create

person = box.get(id)!;       // Read

person.lastName = "Black";
box.put(person);             // Update

box.remove(person.id);       // Delete

// find all people whose name start with letter 'J'
final query = box.query(Person_.firstName.startsWith('J')).build();
final people = query.find();  // find() returns List<Person>
```

## Getting Started

Check out our new [Getting Started guide](https://docs.objectbox.io/getting-started).

We also have some video tutorials, each featuring a different example app:

**Depending on if you are building a Flutter or Dart-only app, follow the steps below to start using ObjectBox.**

### Flutter 

Add these dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  objectbox: ^1.6.2
  objectbox_flutter_libs: any
  # for ObjectBox Sync use this dependency instead:
  # objectbox_sync_flutter_libs: any

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.0.0
  objectbox_generator: any
```

* Install the packages: `flutter pub get`
* **For iOS**: in the Flutter Runner Xcode project
  * increase the deployment target to at least iOS 11 and, 
  * under Architectures, replace `${ARCHS_STANDARD}` with `arm64` (or `$ARCHS_STANDARD_64_BIT`). See [FAQ](https://docs.objectbox.io/faq#on-which-platforms-does-objectbox-run) for details.
* **For sandboxed macOS apps**: specify an application group.
  Check all `macos/Runner/*.entitlements` files if they contain a `<dict>` section with correct group ID info. 
  Change the string value to the `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` found in Xcode settings, plus an application-specific suffix, for example: 
  
  ```xml
  <key>com.apple.security.application-groups</key>
  <array>
    <string>FGDTDLOBXDJ.demo</string>
  </array>
  ```
  
  Next, in the app code, pass the same string when opening the Store, for example: `openStore(macosApplicationGroup: 'FGDTDLOBXDJ.demo')`.  
  Note: Pick a short group identifier; there's an internal limit in macOS that requires the complete string to be 
  19 characters or fewer.
* **For Sync + Android**: in `android/app/build.gradle` set `minSdkVersion 21` in section `android -> defaultConfig`. 
* In order to run Flutter unit tests locally on your machine, install the native ObjectBox library on 
  your host machine (same as you would if you developed for Dart native, as described in the next section):

  ```shell script
  bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart/main/install.sh)
  ```

Continue with the [examples README](example/README.md) to learn how to create entities and use the ObjectBox API.

### Dart Native

Add these dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  objectbox: ^1.6.2

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.0.0
  objectbox_generator: any
```

* Install the packages: `dart pub get`
* Install [objectbox-c](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-c) system-wide (use "Git bash" on Windows):

  ```shell script
  bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart/main/install.sh)
  ```
  
  To install ObjectBox Sync variant of the native library, pass `--sync` argument to the script:
  
  ```shell script
  bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart/main/install.sh) --sync
  ```

Continue with the [examples README](example/README.md) to learn how to create entities and use the ObjectBox API.

## Flutter Database Performance Benchmarks

We tested across the four main database operations, CRUD (create, read, update, delete). Each test was run multiple times and executed  manually outside of the measured time. Data preparation and evaluation were also done outside of the measured time. 

Here are the benchmarks for ObjectBox vs sqflite vs Hive 👇

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart/main/.github/benchmarks.png)

You can run these yourself using our [objectbox-dart-performance](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart-performance) Flutter benchmark app.
