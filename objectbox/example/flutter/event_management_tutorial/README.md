## File structure
```
\--objectbox_flutter_tutorial
    \--event_manager_base
    \--many_to_many
```

- The `event_manager` folder includes the project from the first half of the tutorial where we covered
  modeling and working with one-to-one and one-to-many relationships.
- The `many_to_many` folder contains
  the final extension of the application where we change the task managing section into a many-to-many
  relationship.
